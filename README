README FOR A9CIPHER

Project home: http://code.google.com/p/a9cipher/

For a local copy, use mercurial with
"hg clone https://a9cipher.googlecode.com/hg/ a9cipher"

The packages com.a9development.a9cipher and any subpackages are deprecated and
should not be used. Instead use com.a9development.cipher and it's subpackages.
These deprecated packages are left included as a reference model of how not to
code properly. They were made deprecated due to their poor original layout and
planning. As the project moved forward, a new class layout and inheritence
model evolved, allowing for easier integration of future ciphers.

The com.a9development package contains 2 classes: A9Utility and A9UtilityTests.
These classes are designed to provide a bunch of static utility functions and
a set of JUnit tests for these functions, respectively. 

The cosc385final package contains the source code that was turned in for a
final grade at the completion of the directed study course this project was
created for. It is not to be edited and is there merely as a sort of time 
capsule reflecting the state of the working codebase as of July 31 2010. It
contains classes from the original (now deprecated) com.a9development.a9cipher
packages as well as the newer com.a9development.cipher packages.
